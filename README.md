# Early Detection of SARS-CoV-2 Variants through Dynamic Co-mutation Network Surveillance
A co-mutation network surveillance framework was devised to dynamically investigate the nucleotide covarying pattern of weekly sequences, which is expected to provide earlier detection of SARS-CoV-2 variants overcoming genomic data flood, aiding in the response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
